‚è≤Ô∏è study_timer.py

This module defines a StudyTimer cog for a Discord bot, allowing users to track study sessions
and earn points based on the time they spend studying. Users can start and stop study timers,
and their points are stored in a SQLite database. This module includes cooldown logic to prevent
users from starting multiple sessions too quickly.

Dependencies:
- discord.py
- sqlite3
- logging
