This module uses OpenAI's GPT model to dynamically generate multiple-choice quizzes
based on a given topic. The quiz is returned as structured JSON that includes
questions, choices, and the correct answer.

Requirements:
- OpenAI Python SDK (`openai`)
- A logger utility at `utils.logger` for error reporting
